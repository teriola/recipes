    <h2>A delicious dish for everyone!</h2>
    <p>My aunt makes one of the best banitsas in the world. I've been trying to cook a similarly delicious banitsa as my
        aunt since I was a kid
        and for the last years I've been getting really close. With time I've changed the original recipe a little.
        The result though is always wonderful - superb taste. For this banitsa I recieve many compliments and inquiries
        about the recipe
        by friends. The recipe varies a little depending on the weight of the pasetry and the avaiable products in the
        fridge but overall the proportions are as follows:</p>
    <h3>Products:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350-400 g of pasetry</li>
        <li>5-6 eggs (even if the pasetry I bought is 500 g, I still don't put more than 6 eggs)</li>
        <li>400-500 g of yogurt - 2% (if the pasetry is 500 g, I must add at least 500 g of milk)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>100 ml. oil (I pour by eye from the bottle, but I guess it is about a hundred milliliters)</li>
        <li>300-400 g of feta cheese</li>
        <li>I often add a small amount (about half a cup) of carbonated water or fresh milk,
            but there is no obstacle to making the patty without them - the taste is always wonderful.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The eggs are scrambled in a deep bowl</li>
        <li>The yogurt is added to the mix and then stirr the mixture well</li>
        <li> Add a teaspoon of baking soda and oil to the mixture - 100-150 ml depending on the weight of the pasetry</li>
        <li>Stirr the mixture well again</li>
        <li>If you have fresh milk or sparkling water hanging around the fridge, you can pour some into the mixture</li>
        <li>Finally, the crushed feta cheese is added to the already mixed mixture in the bowl</li>
        <li>The tray is greased with oil and the pastery begins to be lined up in it - two pastery sheet are placed on the bottom of the tray, and they should be shaggy, not folded in half and cover the bottom of the dish</li>
        <li>The two crusts on the bottom are filled with about 1 scoop of the prepared mixture. </li>
        <li>Again, 2 sheet pastery are lined up and filled with mixture, and so on until the crusts and the mixture are finished </li>
        <li>On top of everything you should also put some of the topping mixture</li>
        <li>The banitsa is baked in an oven preheated to 180 degrees with a fan. It takes about half an hour to bake it - you will be guided by the beautiful golden color of the banitsa</li>
        <li>After taking it out of the oven, spray the banitsa with a little cold water and cover it with old newspaper and a kitchen towel on top. After five minutes, you can already cut the banitsa and serve it</li>
